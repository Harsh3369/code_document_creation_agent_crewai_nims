# Building Code Documentation Agents with CrewAI ü§ñ

[![Deploy Now](https://uohmivykqgnnbiouffke.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/landingpage/brevdeploynavy.svg)](https://console.brev.dev/launchable/deploy?launchableID=env-2qNXgLMuzlJ8LS8Kl30EXbGwxSh)

A powerful system that leverages CrewAI Flows to automatically generate comprehensive documentation for any public GitHub repository. This project employs multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively to produce high-quality, accurate documentation tailored to your codebase.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Specialized agents collaborate to analyze and document your code.
- **Automated Documentation**: Full lifecycle coverage, from analysis to review.
- **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Harnesses NVIDIA's llama-3.3-70b and NeMo Retriever E5 embedding models.
- **Mermaid Diagram Support**: Automatically generates architecture and flow diagrams.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness with a built-in review process.

---

## Architecture

The system operates in two main stages:

1. **Codebase Analysis and Strategy Planning**
   - Maps the repository structure.
   - Identifies key components.
   - Develops a documentation strategy.

2. **Documentation Creation and Review**
   - Generates high-level and detailed documentation.
   - Verifies technical accuracy.
   - Checks for consistency and completeness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10+
2. NVIDIA API Key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables (see below).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or execute the Python scripts directly:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Generated documentation will be available in the `docs` directory.

### Setting up NVIDIA API Key

1. Visit [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nim).
2. Select the **llama-3.3-70b-instruct** model.
3. Retrieve your API key from the right panel.
4. Set your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export NIM_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
   Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   NIM_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
