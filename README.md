# Building Code Documentation Agents with CrewAI ü§ñ

[![Deploy Now](https://brev-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nv-lb-dark.svg)](https://console.brev.dev/launchable/deploy?launchableID=env-2qNXgLMuzlJ8LS8Kl30EXbGwxSh)

A powerful system that leverages CrewAI Flows to automatically generate comprehensive documentation for any public GitHub repository. This project employs multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively to produce high-quality, accurate documentation tailored to your codebase.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Specialized agents collaborate to analyze and document your code.
- **Automated Documentation**: Full lifecycle coverage, from analysis to review.
- **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Harnesses NVIDIA's llama-3.3-70b and NeMo Retriever E5 embedding models.
- **Mermaid Diagram Support**: Automatically generates architecture and flow diagrams.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness with a built-in review process.

## Architecture

**The system employs a multi-agent workflow divided into two key stages:**

#### Ingestion Phase
- **WebsiteSearchTool:** This tool is used to embed and index mermaid examples from mermaid.js.org website using NVIDIA NeMo Retriever E5 embedding NIM.

#### Agent Flow
1. Codebase Analysis and Strategy Planning:
    - Analyze Codebase: Planner agents inspect the repository to map its structure, identify key components, and understand interdependencies.
    - Develop Strategy: They create a tailored documentation plan based on the analysis.
2. Documentation Creation and Review:
    - High-Level Documentation: One agent generates clear, comprehensive documentation introducing the project and its architecture.
    - Quality Assurance: Another agent ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness across all documentation.
Here's an architecture diagram of the workflow:
